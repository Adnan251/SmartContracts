# SmartContracts


This Repository is used to store all of my smart contracts created in Solidity 

## Contracts
- **SendETH**   
_This contract is used to send Etherium from one user to a nother, it also saves the transaction info to a state array so that it can be accessed at any time_
- **PaymentSplitter**    
_This contract has a list of accounts, and when a transaction is activated it splits the amount sent equaly to all of those accounts_
